# here is where the user can build a brand new puzzle. I think the ui will be similar - the grid should pop up each new time, and they can input a word for each spot. 
#The only difference will be that instead of comparing their inputs to a solution array, they will be building a solution array. 
#Maybe I could build it so that for each new solution row, a new empty display row is added too.
